<i>Data Science</i> is a hot commodity right now. There's so much buzz about machine learning, natural language processing, AI, among other things, and it doesn't seem like it's slowing down. What does that mean for me? Well, it means I jumped in. I've felt for a while I wanted to get into the coding world. I have a lot of fun working through code, trying to figure out bugs, and getting things to just work. It's really satisfying. Seriously. If you haven't given it a shot, try it. 

But why data science? Honestly, it started out because of the general salaries. I tried out web dev languages like Java Script and Ruby. I liked them. I also love design and really considered going into UX design. I also tried out Kotlin and Swift juggling between the idea of iOS or Android development. I liked all of them. So, why DS? I sat in a Lambda School class and I was just drawn in, and it all has to do with music.

I compose, perform, produce, and digest music constantly. I've written for film and TV. I've had music all over the world, had reviews and interviews in publications such as The Wall Street Journal and radio like NPR and BBC. The thing is, the music industry is a hard industry to make work financially. It takes a lot of money to make a lot. I could go into it deeply, but the point I'm getting at is music tells a story and I love, absolutely love, that part of making music. Data science struck me as having a similar asthetic. 

As far as I'm concerned, data that tells a story that anyone can understand is powerful, and I want to be a part of that. I'm not sure where I'll end up, what industry specifically I'll be in, but I'm excited. I'm nervous. I'm already having crazy imposter syndrome. BUT, I know I'm going to enjoy it. 

I've been in Lambda's Data Science program for a month and a half now and it's been a ride, to say the least. It's hard. At times it's incredibly confusing. It's frustrating. But it's so incredibly satisfying all at once. I love the challenge. I love the insane amount of information I learn every single day. I love working through something and having that breakthrough that feels so, so good. I love it. 

Who knows where this will take me, but I'm in it.
