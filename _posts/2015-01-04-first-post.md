<i>Data Science</i> is a hot commodity right now. There's so much buzz about machine learning, natural language processing, AI, among other things, and it doesn't seem like it's slowing down. What does that mean for me? Well, it means I jumped in. I've felt for a while I wanted to get into the coding world. I have a lot of fun working through code, trying to figure out bugs, and getting things to just work. It's really satisfying. Seriously. If you haven't given it a shot, try it. 

But why data science?
