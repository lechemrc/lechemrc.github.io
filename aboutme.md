My name Rob and I've had a long road leading to tech. I didn't arrive the traditional route, but I believe that to be one of my biggest strengths. 

- I have been a teacher for several years teaching elementary, middle, and high school. I taught all subjects in elementary but focused on math, business, and technology in middle/high school. That teaching time was done on the Navajo Reservation in Monument Valley, UT/AZ. 
- Because of my involvement in math and technology at the school, I came across coding and absolutely fell in love with it.
- I am currently attending Lambda School studying Data Science. So far I have become proficient in: data wrangling, statistical tests and experiments, linear models, basic software engineering, SQL and databases, productization in the cloud, natural language processing, machine learning techniques, and neural networks. I have even had a project published on [Toward Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/can-we-predict-the-outcome-of-pitchfork-music-reviews-3b084d90c18f)
- I worked for a medical start up where I built their audit department and training documents, saving the company tens of thousands of dollars in the process. The documents I created also directly led the company to receive an elite Medicare contract that allowed them to be audited only once a year (previously, it was nearly daily). This efficiency eventually helped lead them to be aquired. 
- I am a musician and composer with projects that have reached millions of listeners. (Main projects: L'anarchiste, VVE - Featured on: MTV, NPR, BBC, The Wall Street Journal, many online blogs and platforms)
- I am an avid outdoorsman and spend much of my time with my family outdoors hiking, camping, backpacking, rafting, and other things.
- I love running and I've run two half marathons so far in Page, AZ and in Joshua Tree, CA. A marathon is in the works!
- More than anything, I love my family. They are why I do what I do.
