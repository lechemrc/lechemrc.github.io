I’m Rob. I'm a data scientist, educator, and creative who took the long way to tech, and that path is my edge.

I began by studying music and pivoted to Business. When I graduated, my wife became a teacher and I followed suit shortly after, working across elementary, middle, and high school on the Navajo Reservation in Monument Valley. Teaching math, business, and technology is where I discovered coding, and fell hard for it, and even helped bring it as an offering for students into the high school.

Because of this newfound love of coding, I then trained in Data Science at Lambda School (now BloomTech), building a strong foundation in data wrangling, statistics, experimentation, SQL, machine learning, NLP, neural networks, and other areas. In this time I published multiple articles in Toward Data Science, exploring both technical concepts and real-world applications.

I became a Data Scientist in a great firm in Kansas City, where I started initially and then went full remote, and now I live and work from Tucson, AZ. Outside of work, you'll find me making music of some sort. Even though I left music as a study, I’m a lifelong musician, producer, and composer. My projects have reached millions of listeners and have been featured by outlets including MTV, NPR, BBC, The Wall Street Journal, Netflix, and Apple. 

You’ll find me outdoors with my family—hiking, camping, backpacking, or trail running (a major passion of mine currently).
Above all, my family is my why. Everything I build—whether in data, education, or music—is rooted in creating something meaningful for those that need it the most.
